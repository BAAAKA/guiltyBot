##Example
**authors\Reinhardt.txt** \
NAME:Reinhard von Lohengramm \
NAME:Lohengramm \
NAME:Reinhard \

As soon as you start front.py, the script will be read all the txt files in there.

Dont forget to put the token.txt file into the same folder (or dont be as lazy as I am and use an environmental variable.)
